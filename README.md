It is important for web designers to work on improving their skills like coding in this area. Images are designed. Visual design focuses on digital products, which determine how a website looks and feels. Web designers also need the soft skills like time management, communication, and problem-solving skills. While doing this course, I am learning how wireframes (a rough website layout) are created and iterated through sitemap.Also, how to edit image using various tools like XD, Illustator etc. By learning this full course, I want to be a web developer so that I can make websites for me as well as for clients. Also, I want to be full stack developer who can do both front end and back end work. By persuing this career in industry, I want to work with top MNCs.
